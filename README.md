On this project, I coded the entire backend of Piiquante, using MongoDB and Node.js to build a RESTful API allowing user authentication and CRUD operations.

Piiquante is a gastronomic advice platform allowing users to connect and post hot sauces and to get comments and like/dislikes froms other users.
